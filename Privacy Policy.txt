Privacy Policy for Roblox Radar

Last Updated: May 26, 2025

SpecT1e (Benjamin Asmark) operates the Roblox Radar Chrome extension (the "Service"). This page informs you of my policies regarding the handling of data when you use my Service.

Information Handling:
Roblox Radar is designed to function primarily by interacting with official Roblox APIs based on your input and by storing your preferences locally on your device.

Data Stored Locally by the Extension (on your computer):
- Tracked Players: If you use the Player Tracker feature, the Roblox UserIDs and/or Usernames you choose to track, along with your notification preferences for these players, are stored locally on your computer using Chrome's `storage.local` API. This information is solely for the Player Tracker to function as intended and to persist your settings across browser sessions. This data is NOT transmitted to me or any third party.
- User Settings: Extension preferences, such as your chosen display theme (light/dark) and the last active tab, are also stored locally using Chrome's `storage.local` API. This is to enhance your user experience and is NOT transmitted to me or any third party.

Data Fetched from Roblox (not stored by me):
- When you use the Server Finder, Player Finder, or Player Tracker features, the extension sends requests to official Roblox APIs. This is based on the Place IDs, UserIDs, or Usernames you provide, or that are present on your active Roblox game tab (when you use the 'Get from Tab' feature with your explicit permission).
- The data returned by Roblox APIs (such as server lists, player online status, and game activity) is displayed to you directly within the extension to provide its features. This data is processed ephemerally (temporarily) for display and is not stored by me. For the Player Tracker, a minimal record of a player's last known status might be kept locally for comparison to trigger notifications, but this is also stored on your device, not my servers.

Clipboard Write Permission:
- The 'Copy Server ID' feature uses the `clipboardWrite` permission to copy a server ID to your clipboard. This action only occurs when you explicitly click the "Copy ID" button. The copied data is not stored or transmitted by the extension or by me.

I do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data or Browse activity on my servers or any third-party servers. All data essential for the extension's custom features (like your list of tracked players and settings) is stored locally on your own device.

Changes to This Privacy Policy:
I may update my Privacy Policy from time to time. I will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date of this Privacy Policy and making it available through my Chrome Web Store listing.
